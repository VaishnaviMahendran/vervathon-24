Problem Statement: 3D model generate from text(Generative AI)
Problem Statement Description:
      This project aims to break down the barriers of traditional 3D modeling by enabling anyone to create detailed,
      high-quality 3D models through simple text input. By harnessing advanced generative AI, this approach empowers 
      designers, developers, and consumers alike to produce assets for games, AR/VR, digital twins, or e-commerce, 
      without the need for specialized software or skills. The solution redefines digital creation, fostering innovation,
      speed, and accessibility across industries.
Technology used:
     Open AI API to include AI technogy to generate 3D model from text.
Learning thing:
    Today we have learned about the AI insertion in our programming language which is completely a new thing and we learned about lots of open ai tools and API methods.
